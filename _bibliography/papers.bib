  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

title={Searching Efficient Semantic Segmentation Architectures via Dynamic Path Selection},
author={Yuxi Liu and Min Liu and Shuai Jiang and Yi Tang and Yaonan Wang},
abstract={Existing NAS methods for semantic segmentation typically apply uniform optimization to all candidate networks (paths) within a one-shot supernet. However, the concurrent existence of both promising and suboptimal paths often results in inefficient weight updates and gradient conflicts. This issue is particularly severe in semantic segmentation due to its complex multi-branch architectures and large search space, which further degrade the supernet’s ability to accurately evaluate individual paths and identify high-quality candidates. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Path Selection (DPS), a selective training strategy that leverages multiple performance proxies to guide path optimization. DPS follows a stagewise paradigm, where each phase emphasizes a different objective: early stages prioritize convergence, the middle stage focuses on expressiveness, and the final stage emphasizes a balanced combination of expressiveness and generalization. At each stage, paths are selected based on these criteria, concentrating optimization efforts on promising paths, thus facilitating targeted and efficient model updates. Additionally, DPS integrates a dynamic stage scheduler and a diversity-driven exploration strategy, which jointly enable adaptive stage transitions and maintain structural diversity among selected paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under the same search space, DPS can discover efficient models with strong generalization and superior performance.},

  title={Automated Neural Architecture Design for Industrial Defect Detection},
  abstract={Industrial surface defect detection (SDD) is critical for ensuring product quality and manufacturing reliability. Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of surface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and interclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed models, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address both challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose AutoNAD, an automated neural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range semantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of manual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search space, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates supernet convergence and improves subnet performance. Additionally, a searchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) is integrated to enhance multi-scale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime efficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD incorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient architectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial defect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection platform.},

  title={Category-Agnostic Cluster-Guided Selective Suppression for Weakly Supervised Surface Defect Localization}, 
  abstract={Surface defect localization is indispensable for the quality control of industrial products in the manufacturing process, supervised dense prediction of defect areas requires laborious and difficult pixel-level annotations. On the contrary, weakly supervised defect localization (WSDL) is much more practicable, and the class activation maps (CAMs) generated with image-level labels can serve as prior knowledge or cues for downstream tasks. However, due to interference of unforeseen background objects that may have high confidence in activation maps instead, the localization maps obtained from general WSDL methods are prone to be unreliable, which leads to errors or even missing localization. Therefore, in this article, we innovatively propose a simple, yet effective cluster-guided selective suppression (CSS) strategy for weakly supervised surface defect localization, aiming at the rectification of CAMs, thus producing more reliable localization maps. Specifically, CSS leverages converted rectangle patch pairs generated from CAMs and performs unsupervised vector-level cluster analysis, all patches are classified into defective or nondefective clusters. Subsequently, a categoryagnostic cluster is selected to provide suppression feedback for the image suppressor, and the suppressed images are recycled for feature re-learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art WSDL performance on three public datasets of metal and magnetic-tile surfaces, with average classification and localization accuracy improved by 7.19% and 5.40%, respectively.},
